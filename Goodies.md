## YO YO YOOOO

### Terminal Usage:
1. **ls** - lists all(non-hidden) files and folders in current directory
2. **cd** - changing directories...aka where you currently are in the terminal
    - cd ~ - goes to the root
    - **cd nameOfFolder** - goes to designated folder 
    - **cd ../** - goes back a folder
3. **javac fileName.java** - compiles your code in class files for JVM
4. **java fileName** - runs yo code
5. **Git Stuff**
    - **git add .** - adds all changes to staging area
    - **git commit -m "ur msg"** - commits your changes and allows you to add in a commit message in the quotes
    - **git push** - pushes your commit
    - **git status** - shows if you got anything in the staging area
    - There's a whole bunch of commands not listed here so I'll just leave a link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-12-most-used-git-commands-for-developers/

### Extensions for VS Code (java focused for now)....I don't use eclipse cuz I would like to stay sane :)
1. **Debugger for Java** 
2. **Maven for Java**
3. **Spring Boot Tools**
4. **Java Extension Pack**
5. **GitHub PR** - You can use the GitHub Desktop app too, it's very friendly for new users!
6. **Live Share**
7. **Visual Studio IntelliCode** - I haven't extensively tested it but pretty good AI-assisted development 

### Other Random Stuff 
1. **NVM** - Node version manager, swaps node ver. with 1 command line
2. **brew** - For mac only!! Downloads and manages software/libraries/etc, blessed by Steve Jobs himself 
3. **SDKMan** - Samething as NVM but for windows and works for lots of things incl. Java
